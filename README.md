# Introduction to Robotics (2022 - 2023)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework 1
Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue).  The control must be done with digital electronics.

## Homework 3
