# Introduction to Robotics (2022 - 2023)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework 1
Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue).  The control must be done with digital electronics.

## Homework 3
With a 7-segment display, use the joystick to control the position ofthe segment and "draw" on the display. The movement between segments should be natural (meaning they should jump from the current position only to neighbors, but without passing through "walls").

## Homework 4
Use the joystick to move through the 4 digit 7-segment displays digits, press the button to lock in on the current digit and use the other axis to increment or decrement the number. Keep the button pressed to reset all the digit values and the current position to the first digit in the first state.
